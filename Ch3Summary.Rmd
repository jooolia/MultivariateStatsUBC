# Fundamental principles

- Dimensional analysis can be used to simplify equations into dimensionless variables. 
- This type of analysis only works on dimensionally homogeous equations. -> have the same dimensions. 

# Example:

Let's estimate the drag experimenced by an object immersed in a current.

Assumptions:
- The immersed object is a smooth sphere.
- The velocity of the current V is constant.
